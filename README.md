# digital-frame

This project is a gift idea for my parents that have a lot of digital photos and that complained about issues with their current store bought digital photo frame.

Because i am a fan of RaspberryPi, i decided to go the DIY route and create a better digital photo frame, suited to their needs.

Using the `feh` app i am amble to have it autostart at boot and go randomly through all the pictures in a folder and sub folders.

## Installation

Execute the command below in a terminal to install the slideshow
